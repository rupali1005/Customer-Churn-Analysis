## Introduction
Customer churn is a critical concern for businesses across industries. This project examines a financial services dataset to understand churn patterns, identify at risk customer segments, and provide data-driven recommendations to reduce churn rates.

## Features
- Comprehensive SQL analysis of customer demographics and behavior
- Interactive Power BI dashboards with filtering capabilities
- Segmentation analysis by geography, age, gender, and financial attributes
- Correlation analysis between multiple factors affecting churn
- Visual representation of key churn indicators and trends

## Technologies Used
- MySQL for data extraction and analysis
- Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation
- SQL for data querying and manipulation

## Data Analysis
The analysis explores:
- Overall churn rate and distribution across demographics
- Customer behavior patterns related to tenure, product usage, and activity
- Credit score and financial metrics correlation with churn
- Geographic variations in customer retention
- Ranking of customers based on various financial attributes

## Dashboard Overview
The Power BI dashboard consists of multiple visualizations including:
- Churned customer distribution by gender and geography
- Age group analysis of churned customers
- Credit score range analysis
- Card usage and membership activity metrics
- Tenure-based churn patterns

## Key Insights
- The overall churn rate is 20.37%, indicating significant opportunity for improvement
- Germany has the highest churn rate, particularly among the 36-45 age demographic
- Customers with credit scores below 500 show higher vulnerability to churn
- Inactive members represent nearly 48% of the customer base and churn at higher rates
- Customers with multiple products (more than 2) show significantly higher churn rates
- Geography-specific patterns indicate need for region-targeted retention strategies
- There is a correlation between balance levels and churn behavior

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Import the SQL schema using the provided script
3. Run the MySQL queries to analyze the data
4. Open the Power BI file to view the dashboard

## SQL Queries
The project includes queries ranging from basic to advanced analysis:
- Basic queries for demographic analysis
- Intermediate queries for behavioral patterns
- Advanced queries using CTEs and window functions for detailed segmentation
